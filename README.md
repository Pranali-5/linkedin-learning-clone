# Team management and working together:

As we assigned the project on 20th j uly 2021 and also we have got the name of our team
members. On the 20th j uly we talked with each other about the project and j oined a
meeting together i n which we explored the original website, understood the building
architecture of the website and the website working flow. After doing these things we made
our plan i n what flow we have to complete this and also decided a deadline from our side.
Deciding the deadline helped a l ot to build this website clone on time.

# Work division and working together:

We four people were i n a team. So after exploring the website and their flow we talked
about who i s good i n what technology. “ Knowing the strengths of team members helps to
complete the task efficiently and in the given timeline.” We decided and divided the task
between us and we started the work right after meeting. I took two days to complete the
task from my side. And everyone did their work on time and also before the decided time.
It was our initial work that we did in just two days. Then we decided to add some more
pages to our website and some more functionality.
